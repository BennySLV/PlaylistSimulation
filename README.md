# PlaylistSimulation
This project involves creating a fictitious playlist application, using both the data structures ArrayList and LinkedList.  This particular project is the final part of section 8 of the Complete Java Masterclass for Software Developers course.  Created by Tim Buchalka.

Note that this is a terminal application but it can also be run from any appropriate IDE.
